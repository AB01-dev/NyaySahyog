__SIH 2023 Project__

India's legal service sector stands at the threshold of a transformative change, propelled by the
power of digital innovation. The existing landscape, characterized by fragmentation and lack of
transparency, has long hindered citizens' access to legal services. The need for a centralized, user-
friendly platform is undeniable. In response, our project, website titled "Nyay Sahyog," aims to
bridge this gap by conceptualizing and designing an incentivized e-Marketplace that brings
together legal service providers and citizens. This pioneering platform seeks to not only simplify
the process of finding the right legal expert but also promote transparency, quality, and
accessibility.

**Objective:** The objective of our project is to develop an innovative solution that onboards diverse
legal service providers, including advocates, arbitrators, mediators, notaries, and document
writers, onto a unified e-marketplace. This platform will employ an incentivized design to
encourage legal service providers to offer their expertise. Our focus lies in addressing the key
challenges faced in the legal service sector in India, such as incentivization, transparency, quality
assurance, efficient matchmaking, and inclusivity across socio-economic backgrounds.
